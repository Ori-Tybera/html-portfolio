    <H1>The Best Movies According to Ori</H1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse</h3>
    <p>This movie is fantastic; it has insanely good art direction, each frame is carefully crafted, each character is unique, and the way the entire art style constantly changes is beautiful.</p>
<h3>If</h3>
    <p>This is a beautifully sad story about a girl reliving her childhood while her father undergoes surgery.</p>
<h3>Moana</h3>
    <p>In my opinion, the best disney movie of all time. Moana's journey where she sets sail to have Maui put back the heart, but ends up becoming a wayfinder herself to put back the heart on her own, facing challenges across the sea, is an amazing story.</p>
